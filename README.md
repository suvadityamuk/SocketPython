# SocketPython
This repository contains files which can allow you to connect 2 computers present on the same network and establish communication between them.  
This functionality can be advanced to allow communication between 2 geographically-distanced locations as well using Port/NAT forwarding.

This package is also maintained in a continuous build using GitHub Actions
